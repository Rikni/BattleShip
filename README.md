## Usage

Here's a short explanation on how to use **Battleship**:

* Use `Battleship` to run the code, after following the installation steps.
* When the application starts, you, the player, sets up your board by typing in the on-screen coordinates.
* Then, the computer makes its own board and you play against it by guessing its ships' locations.
	* NOTE: The computer's board is printed on screen, just so the game can go faster.
* The program ends when one side beats the other.
